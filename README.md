# DataGovernanceAccelerator
Currently, data governance is grappling with a public relations challenge.The topic of data governance seems abstract to far too many people without a full appreciation of its definition, role, and value. You may have experienced puzzled looks from friends, family, and colleagues when you told them that your work involves data governance.If you’re going to communicate the importance of data governance to your organization, you can first, for example, build a business case to explain the topic clearly.What is meant by governance? When first presented with the phrase data governance, most people immediately understand the data part, but can be quickly confused by the use and context of the word “governance.” Governance is not a word that most of us use on a regular basis. Sure, you create data. You use data. You store data. These concepts make sense. But governing data? That’s not something that comes up too often. It sounds abstract, a little exotic, and frankly, complicated. Fortunately, it’s not nearly as complex as it appears. Understanding what it means right now, in the context of data, will put you at ease as you immerse yourself in the world of data governance.The many domains that have adopted the term governance apply it relative to intent. Project governance, for example, is focused on a process for how project decisions are made and how communications are managed between stakeholders. Another area, land governance, concerns itself with issues relative to land ownership and the rules under which decisions are made around land use and control.
What is data governance?
As the video explained to be effective at their jobs, staff want to find the data they need quickly, and they want it to be high-quality data. This means the data needs to be accurate and current. Leaders want data to provide the basis for rich insights that enable timely and informed data-driven decision-making. The legal department requires data to be handled by everyone in a manner consistent with laws and regulations. Product designers want data to inform creative decisions that align with marketplace demands and customer trends. Security professionals are tasked with ensuring that the data is appropriately protected.
Data Governance Versus Data Management
Within the EIM space, there are many terms that sound like they might mean the same thing. There is often confusion about the difference between data governance and data management. Data governance is focused on roles and responsibilities, policies, definitions, metrics, and the lifecycle of data. Data management is the technical implementation of data governance. For example, databases, data warehouses and lakes, application programming interfaces (APIs), analytics software, encryption, data crunching, and architectural design and implementation are all data management features and functions.
Data Governance versus Information Governance
Similarly, in EIM, you may want clarity on the difference between data governance and information governance. Data governance generally focuses on data, independent of its meaning. For example, you may want to govern the security of patient data and staff data from a policy and process perspective, despite their differences. The interest here is in the data, not as much in the business context. Information governance is entirely concerned with the meaning of the data and its relationship in terms of outcomes and value to the organization, customers, and other stakeholders.
The Value of Data Governance
If an organization considers data to be a priority — and an increasing number of businesses believe just that (in fact, according to Anmut- a data consultancy, 91 percent of business leaders say that data is a critical part of their organization’s success) — and it puts in place processes and policies to leverage the data’s value and reduce data risks, that organization is demonstrating a strong commitment to data controls and accountabilities. In other words, that organization values data governance.
Creating a Data Governance Program
Defining the vision, goals, and benefits.
Analyzing the current state of data governance and management.
Developing a proposal based on the first two steps, including a draft plan.
Achieving leadership approval.
Designing and developing the program.
Implementing the program.
Monitoring and measuring performance.
Maintaining the program.

Developing a Data Governance Framework
You cannot buy a data governance program off the shelf. That’s actually good news. Organizations must implement a program relative to its level of interest, as well as its needs, budget, and capabilities. Even a modest effort can produce meaningful results.Regardless of how and to what degree you implement the elements of a data governance program, you’ll need a basic set of guiding concepts and a structure in which to apply them. This is called the data governance framework.
Leadership and Strategy
Your data governance program must be aligned with the strategy of the organization. For example, how can data governance support the role that data plays in enabling growth in specific markets? Data plays a role in many aspects of organizational strategy, including risk management, innovation, and operational efficiencies, so you must ensure there’s a clear alignment between these aspects and the goals of data governance.
Roles and Responsibilities
Your data governance program will only be possible with the right people doing the right things at the right time. Every data governance framework includes the identification and assignment of specific roles and responsibilities, which range from the information technology (IT) team to data stewards.
Policies, Processes, and Standards
At the heart of every data governance program are the policies, processes, and standards that guide responsibilities and support uniformity across the organization. Each of these must be designed, developed, and deployed. Depending on the size and complexity of the organization, this can take significant effort.
Metrics
The data governance program must have a mechanism to measure whether it is delivering the expected results. Capturing metrics and delivering them to a variety of stakeholders is important for maintaining support, which includes funding. You’ll want to know if your efforts are delivering on the promise of the program. Based on the metrics, you and your team can make continuous improvements (or make radical changes) to ensure that the program is producing value.
Tools
Fortunately, a large marketplace now exists for tools in support of data governance and management. These include tools for master data management, data catalogs, search, security, integration, analytics, and compliance. In recent years, many data science-related tools have made leaps in terms of incorporating ease-of-use and automation. What used to be complex has been democratized and empowered more team members to better manage and derive value from data.
Communications and Collaboration
With the introduction of data governance and the ongoing, sometimes evolving, requirements, high-quality communications are key. This takes many forms, including in-person meetings, emails, newsletters, and workshops. Change management, in particular, requires careful attention to ensure that impacted team members understand how the changes brought about by the data governance program affect them and their obligations.
Preparing for Data Governance
It might seem a good idea just to form a team, create a plan, buy some tools, and then implement data governance. That would be a mistake. Data governance requires careful treatment, beginning with understanding whether an organization is ready to accept it. As the following sections make clear, there are some traps that you can avoid if you and your team are diligent.Being ready as an organization involves determining the extent to which a data culture exists. Intuitively you can conclude that an immature, reactive data culture, where data is simply handled in an ad hoc manner, is an entirely different experience than a sophisticated data-driven culture.
What is data culture?
Many well-designed projects and initiatives fall flat and fail even though their teams seem to have done everything right. Too often, the work gets deployed into an environment that is either not ready for change or doesn’t have the optimum conditions for success. A study by IDC (International Data Corporation) noted that organizations are spending billions of dollars on technological upgrades — digitally transforming their businesses — and 70 percent are failing because they don’t have the prerequisite data culture to support these efforts.
Assessing the Data Culture
If you want to increase your chances of success - you need to understand the data culture of your organization and determine how to broaden and mature it if necessary. You need an environment for success.Effective data cultures support and empower all employees, from the newest intern to the CEO, to access and use meaningful and timely data for their work. Such cultures ensure that employees have attained the skills they need to use data analytics and can make good data-driven decisions. It’s not an overstatement to say that these types of organizations are often defined by their enlightened and competitive use of data.
Maturing the Data Culture
Help leaders communicate the value of data and model the type of behavior that demonstrates that data is a priority. This must include communicating the positive results of using data.
Provide basic tools and education for data use that include manipulating data, analytics, data cleansing, basic query commands, and visualization. Don’t overlook the remarkable capabilities of common applications such as spreadsheets.
Do something, even if it’s small, to show progress. A successful data culture doesn’t begin with the deployment of complex, far-reaching solutions. Rather, it can be eased into the organization via basic data-management skills offered in a classroom setting or online.
Recognize that resistance and frustration are part of the journey. Rather than fighting it, find ways to bring comfort and rewards to team members. At a minimum, provide a channel for feedback and positive discussion.
Assessing Data Governance Readiness
So, you’ve either determined your organization has a good data culture, or you’ve put into action some steps to help move it forward, and now you’ve decided it’s time to roll up your sleeves and begin designing a data governance program. Right? Unfortunately, it’s not that easy. There are a few other items you should consider in order to determine if your organization is ready for a data governance program. If the right conditions don’t exist, you may be walking into a minefield, only one step away from disaster.
Defining Data
We have to be on the same page. Data has a specific meaning and it’s really important to be clear on the definition, particularly as we start talking about information, knowledge, and insights. But it’s even more important as we consider data in the context of governance and management. After all, as will soon be made clear, data governance is not the same as data management.
Why all the focus on data?
Data refers to collections of digitally stored units, in other words, stuff that is kept on a computing device. These units represent something meaningful when processed for a human or a computer. Single units of data are traditionally referred to as datum and multiple units as data. However, the term data is often used in singular and plural contexts and, in this course, We are going to simply refer to both as data. Data is also defined based on its captured format. Specifically, at a high level, it falls into one of the following categories:
Structured: Data that has been formatted to a set structure; each data unit fits nicely into a table in a database. It’s ready for analysis. Examples include first name, last name, and phone number.
Unstructured: Data that are stored in a native format must be processed to be used. Further work is required to enable analysis. Examples include email content and social media posts.
Semi-structured: Data that contains additional information to enable the native format to be searched and analyzed.
Welcome to The Zettabyte Era
![image](https://github.com/matthew23-stack/DataGovernanceAccelerator/assets/127289268/6ff96580-2ff7-4abd-8ffc-df0ecf14ee91)
Today, we live in the zettabyte era. A zettabyte is a big number. A really big number. It’s 1021, or a 1 with 21 zeros after it. It looks like this: 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes.By 2020, we had created 64 zettabytes of data*. That number continues to grow rapidly. This datasphere — the term used to describe all the data created — is projected to reach over 100 zettabytes by 2023 and may double in 3-4 years. If you own a terabyte drive at home or for school, you’d need one billion of those drives to store just one zettabyte of data.It was a mutually beneficial decision. We understand the A; the computer understands the 01000001. A full word such as “hello” converted to binary reads: 01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111. With more data being produced in the years ahead, we’ll soon begin adopting other words to describe even bigger volumes. Get ready for the Yottabyte and Brontobyte eras.

From Data to Insight
Creating, collecting, and storing data is a waste of time and money if it’s being done without a clear purpose or intent to use it in the future. Certain exceptions may be logical to collect data even when we don’t have a reason because it may have value at some point in the future, but this is only an exception. Generally, an organization is onboarding data because it’s required for some purpose. ![image](https://github.com/matthew23-stack/DataGovernanceAccelerator/assets/127289268/c369f9e5-c692-4c06-9395-1091bf61be8e)
To go further than this. When we take new knowledge and apply reasoning, values, and the broader universe of our knowledge and deep experiences, we get wisdom. With wisdom, we know what to do with knowledge and can determine its contextual validity. We could have stopped at knowledge, but wisdom takes us to the ultimate destination derived from data. All wisdom includes knowledge, but not all knowledge is wisdom. Finally, insight is an outcome that can emerge from knowledge but is best demonstrated through a combination of knowledge and wisdom. With insight, we’ve gained a deeper understanding of something and have the skills to think or see it differently. To summarize, consider the following:Harry Styles is data.
The fact that Harry Styles is a singer and was in the group, One Direction, is information.The fact that Harry Styles has aspirations to become a solo artist and is looking for a record deal is knowledge.The fact that One Direction was a very successful band with talented and popular individuals and knowing that Harry Styles is a creative artist who now wants a solo record deal is wisdom.Ensuring that Columbia Records make the decision to sign Harry Styles before anyone else does is insight.![image](https://github.com/matthew23-stack/DataGovernanceAccelerator/assets/127289268/c282a7f1-c2a7-43dd-bd20-fded0c2dffd7) ![image](https://github.com/matthew23-stack/DataGovernanceAccelerator/assets/127289268/004bf7b2-f453-46e7-895f-1353811355cb)
The Role of Data in the 21st Century
Since the early days of data processing in the 19th and 20th centuries right through to digital transformation in the 21st century, data has played many important roles. It’s helped us understand the world in completely new ways, improved our ability to make better-informed decisions, and supported our efforts to solve all manner of problems. In this way, it’s fair to say that data has always been important.
Data-Driven Decision-Making
Perhaps one of the greatest values of data is its ability to help us all make better decisions. Intuitively reading the customer reviews of a restaurant on a website such as Hello Peter or Google Reviews can help you decide whether you want to eat there. It’s valuable to you, but it’s also valuable to the restaurant owner. Those reviews can make a big difference, including being a motivation for action. Perhaps the restrooms should be cleaner.Deciding on a restaurant based on reviews is an example of data-driven decision-making, but it’s also on the less complex end of the decision-making spectrum.
Data as The New Oil
A popular refrain coined by the mathematician Clive Humby in 2006 is that data is the new oil. Just as oil drove and grew economies in the past, data is doing that now. Some have subsequently added that just like oil, data has value but must first be processed to be useful. Specifically, oil is refined to make gas, plastics, and other useful chemicals. In a similar fashion, data must be organized and analyzed to understand patterns, make decisions, identify problems, and feed other systems.As oil powered the industrial economies of the 19th and 20th centuries, data is powering the digital economies of the 21st century. The big economic powerhouses are being powered by data, such as the technology firms Facebook and Google. While they dominate, every other industry from banking to government and beyond is being reinvented by digitalization and data. Many are moving data management from a cost center to a profit center by making data power their businesses and generate new sources of revenue.
Data Ownership
Data ownership describes the rights a person, team, or organization has over one or more data sets. These rights may span from lightweight oversight and control to rigorous rules that are legally enforceable. For example, data associated with intellectual property — items such as copyrights and trade secrets — will likely have high degrees of protection, from accessibility rights to who can use the data and for what purpose.
Data Architecture
Today, it’s not an exaggeration to state that almost every organization is a technology business. After all, what businesses can function without having systems to support their operations and deliver their products and services? When designing the technical needs of an organization to support its business strategy, this practice is known as enterprise architecture (EA). Using standards and established principles, organizations can analyze, design, plan, and implement the right technologies, policies, and projects to support business goals.Ensuring data is available to those who need it and are approved to use it.
Reducing the complexity of accessing and utilizing data
Creating and enforcing data protections to support organizational policies and obligations.
Adopting and agreeing to data standards
Optimizing the flow and efficient use of data to eliminate bottlenecks and duplication
The Lifecycle of Data
![image](https://github.com/matthew23-stack/DataGovernanceAccelerator/assets/127289268/b8a70d30-f1bc-4dca-95bf-d50b489a6e55)
Creation:  This is the stage at which data comes into being. It may be manual or automated and get created internally or externally. Data is created all the time by a vast number of activities that include system inputs and outputs.
Storage:  Once data is created and assuming you want it available for later use, it must be stored. It most likely will be contained and managed in a database. The database needs a home, too as a local hard drive, server, or cloud service.
Usage:  Hopefully you’re capturing and storing data because you want to use it. Maybe not immediately, but at some point, perhaps for analysis. Data may need to be processed to be useful. That could include cleansing it of errors, transforming it to another format, and securing access rights.
Archival:  In this stage, you identify data that is not currently being used and move it to a long-term storage system out of your production environment. If it's needed at some point in the future, it can be retrieved and utilized.
Destruction:  Despite a desire by some to keep everything forever, there is a logical point where destruction makes sense or is required by regulation or policy. Data destruction involves making data inaccessible and unreadable. It can include the physical destruction of a device such as a hard drive.
Understanding the Impact of Big Data
Data isn’t some kind of new phenomenon. In fact, we’ve been capturing and storing data in an analog fashion for thousands of years. The Romans, for example, used ledgers to keep track of their various activities across their expansive empire.Fast-forward to the 20th century and the Cold War was instrumental in the technological leaps that resulted in microprocessors and the classical computing we use today. One by-product of the Cold War, the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union, accelerated innovation in computing and telecommunications.
The Role of The U.S. Census in The Information Revolution
Processing data on some form of computing device has been around since the late 1800s. In fact, the need for a mechanism to better tabulate the results of the U.S. constitutional requirement to conduct a population census every ten years is said to be the origin of data processing. Counting all the people and other data points in the 1880 census took almost eight years. It’s assumed it was full of errors. It was also a boring, tedious process. Credit for the first company to automate and commercialize the processing of this data goes to the Tabulating Machine Company, founded in 1896.
Defining Big Data
Volume: The sheer scale of data being produced is unprecedented and requires new tools, skills, and processes.
Variety: There are already a lot of legacy file formats, such as CSV and MP3, and with new innovations, new formats are emerging all the time. This requires different methods of handling, from analysis to security.
Velocity: With so many collection points, digital interfaces, and ubiquitous connectivity, data is being created and moved at increasing speed. Consider that in 2021, Instagram users created, uploaded, and share 65,000 pictures a minute.
Variability:  The fact that the creation and flow of data are unpredictable.
Veracity:  The quality, including accuracy and truthfulness, of large volume of disparate sets of data, can differ considerably, causing challenges to data management.
Drivers of Big Data
At a technology conference in 2003, the then-CEO of Google, Eric Schmidt. At the time said that every two days the world was creating more data than all the data created since the dawn of civilization.By the third decade of the 21st century, with so many devices connected and the world in a state of digital transformation, the volume of data being created had experienced a Cambrian explosion — a term the data science community has adopted from an early period in history notable for the rapid introduction of life into the natural environment. We were regularly well into the zettabyte range of data and its growth curve was continuing relentlessly (see Figure 7).![image](https://github.com/matthew23-stack/DataGovernanceAccelerator/assets/127289268/1bd0f1cb-2f55-4af4-8b18-0a56787cd1b2)
Consequences of Big Data
An over-used quote attributed to the 19th century U.S. retailer John Wanamaker stated that half his advertising budget was wasted but he just didn’t know which half. In a time when advertising was mainly billboards and newspapers, it was nearly impossible to know which advertising resulted in a sale. Today, a combination of hyperconnectivity and data has upended this predicament. Marketers using the latest technology can better understand the marketplace in granular detail. They can target specific audiences, and even specific individuals, where the chance of a sale is highest.
Enter the Realm of Smart Data
Smart data has emerged as a new term that defines big data that’s been optimally prepared for use to deliver the highest business value. Instead of being overwhelmed by the distractions inherent to the volume, velocity, and variety of data in big data sets, processes are applied to big data to prepare it for specific uses. For example, marketing teams can target potential customers with precision. Analytics applications can use high-quality real-time data generated in a manufacturing setting.
Identifying the Roles of Data
To fully appreciate the value that data brings to every organization, it’s worth exploring the many ways that data shows up on a daily basis. Recognizing the incredible diversity of data use and the exposure it has across all business functions reinforces its importance. It's critical to ensure that data is high quality, secure, compliant, and accessible to the right people at the right time.
Operations
Business operations concern themselves with a diverse set of activities to run the day-to-day needs and drive the mission of an organization. Each business has different needs, and operational functions reflect these specific requirements. Some core functions show up in almost every organization. Consider payroll, order management, and marketing. At the same time, some operational support won’t be required. Not every organization needs its own IT organization, or if it’s a service business, it may not have a warehouse.
Strategy
Every organization has a strategy, whether it’s articulated overtly or not. At the organizational level, this is about creating a plan that supports objectives and goals. It’s essentially about understanding the challenges to delivering on the organization’s purpose and then agreeing on the proposed solutions to those challenges. Strategy can also be adopted at the department and division levels, but the intent is the same: understand the journey ahead and make a plan.
Decision-Making
Popular consumer search engines such as Google and Bing have transformed how we make decisions. Doctors, for example, now deal with patients who are more informed about their symptoms and their causes. It also has its pitfalls. Some of the information has reduced unnecessary clinic visits, but it’s also created a headache for physicians when the information their patients have consumed is incorrect.
Measuring
Organizations are in a continuous state of measurement, whether it’s overt or tacit. Every observed unit of data contributes to building a picture of the business. The often-used adage, what gets measured gets managed, is generally applicable. That said, some things are hard to measure and not everything gets measured.
Monitoring
This is an ongoing process of collecting and evaluating the performance of, say, a project, process, system, or another item of interest. Often the results collected are compared against some existing values or desired targets. For example, a machine on a factory floor may be expected to produce 100 widgets per hour. You engage in some manner of monitoring in order to inform whether, in fact, this expectation is being met. Across a wide range of activities, monitoring also helps to ensure the continuity, stability, and reliability of that being supervised.
Insight Management
Data forms the building blocks of many business functions. In support of decision-making — arguably its most important value — data is the source for almost all insight. As a basic definition, business insight is sometimes referred to as information that can make a difference.
Reporting
Perhaps the most obvious manifestation of data and information management in any organization is the use of reports. Creating, delivering, receiving, and acting on reports are fundamental functions of any organization. Some say they are the backbone of every business. That sounds overly glamorous, but it does speak to the importance of reporting and reports.
Other Roles for Data
While we’ve gone over a number of the most visible uses of data in organizations today, it was not the intent to list every conceivable way that data is used. That said, here’s a short list of some other important areas that we should not omit.
Artificial intelligence (AI):  Data is considered the fuel of AI. It requires a high volume of good data. With huge quantities of quality data, the outcomes of AI improve. It’s from the data that AI learns patterns, identifies relationships, and determines probabilities. In addition, AI is being used to improve the quality and use of data in organizations. 
Problem-solving:  Acknowledging the close association with decision-making, it’s worth calling out problem-solving as a distinctive use of data. Data plays a role in how a problem is defined, determining what solutions are available, evaluating which solution to use, and measuring the success or failure of the solution that is chosen and applied.
Data reuse:  While we collect and use data for a specific primary purpose, data is often reused for entirely different reasons. Data that has been collected, used, and stored can be retrieved and used by a different team at another time - assuming they have permission, including access and legal rights (notable controls within data governance). For example, the sales team in an organization will collect your name and address in order to fulfill an order. Later, that same data set may be used by the marketing team to create awareness about other products and services. These are two different teams with different goals using the same data. Data reuse can be considered a positive given that it reduces data collection duplication and increases the value of data to an organization, but it must be managed with care so that it doesn’t break any data use rules. (Note: High-value shared data sets are called master data, and in data governance, they are subject to master data management.)
Improving Outcomes with Data
Now that the diverse roles of data have been identified and discussed, it’s useful to understand how data can be leveraged to acquire its maximum value. It begins with recognizing that data is an organizational asset. This simply means that it’s something that brings economic value to the organization. It’s clear to see this when it is pointed out, but many team members don’t yet look at data this way. When data is considered an asset - in fact, specifically a high-value asset - it often gets treated differently.
Approaching Data as an Asset
An asset is something that is owned by a person, an organization, or a government with the expectation that it can bring some economic benefit. This includes the generation of income, the reduction of expenses, or an increase in net worth.Improves operations.
Increases existing revenue.
Produces new forms of revenue.
Builds relationships with customers and other stakeholders.
Improves the quality of products and services.
Contributes to competitive advantage.
Enables innovation.
Reduces risk.
Data Analytics
Raw data is largely useless. If you’ve ever briefly glanced at a large data set that has columns and rows of numbers, it quickly becomes clear that not much can be gathered from it.In order to make sense of data, you have to apply specific tools and techniques. The process of examining data in order to produce answers or find conclusions is called data analytics. A formal and disciplined approach is conducted by a data analyst, and it’s a necessary step for any individual or organization that’s trying to make good decisions for their organization.
Descriptive:  Existing data sets of historical data are accessed, and analysis is performed to determine what the data tells stakeholders about the performance of a key performance indicator (KPI) or other business objectives. It is insight on past performance.
Diagnostic:  As the term suggests, this analysis tries to glean from the data the answer to why something happened. It takes descriptive analysis and looks at the cause.
Predictive:  In this approach, the analyst uses techniques to determine what may occur in the future. It applies tools and techniques to historical data and trends to predict the likelihood of certain outcomes.
Prescriptive:  This analysis focuses on what action should be taken. In combination with predictive analytics, prescriptive techniques provide estimates of the probabilities of a variety of future outcomes.
Data Management
Data governance concerns itself with, for example, defining the roles, policies, controls, and processes for increasing the quality and value of organizational data.Data management is the implementation of data governance. Without data management, data governance is just wishful thinking. To get value from data, there must be execution.
Who would choose to make decisions based on bad data?
On the other hand, good data management can result in more success in the marketplace. When data is handled and treated as a valuable enterprise asset: insights are richer and timelier, operations run smoother, and team members have what they need to make more informed decisions. Well-executed data management can translate to reduced data security breaches, and lower compliance, regulatory, and privacy issues.
Governing Data
Governing data means that some level of control exists to support a related policy. For example, an organization may decide that to reduce risk, there needs to be a policy that requires data to be backed up every day. The control would be the documentation of the process and enforcement of that policy. If, in the review of policy adherence, data wasn’t getting backed up, then you’d quickly know that governance, for whatever reason, was not working.
Examining the Broader Value of Data
In small organizations or when a business is first created, only a few systems are used, and team members know the type and location of most of the data that is available. You can imagine, for example, basic repositories for customer data, invoices, and marketing materials.
